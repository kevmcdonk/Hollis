## Hollis

This is a collection of web-parts to help to build up a Digital Workplace. They are not an out of the box Intranet as many great companies offer such as Add-In365, Valo and Powell. Instead this is a kickstart for anyone looking to build their own but with a focus on modern, intelligence driven information through the use of Bots and Cognitive Services.

You can read more about the workings on this at https://www.mcd79.com.

### Building the code

```bash
git clone the repo
npm i
npm i -g gulp
gulp
```

This package produces the following:

* lib/* - intermediate-stage commonjs build artifacts
* dist/* - the bundled script, along with other resources
* deploy/* - all resources which should be uploaded to a CDN.

### Build options

gulp clean - TODO
gulp test - TODO
gulp serve - TODO
gulp bundle - TODO
gulp package-solution - TODO

### Why Hollis?

Stretching my geek limits here. It's named after Ray Hollis, the head of a psychic organisation in Philip K Dick's novel Ubik. Why? The aim of these tools are to help get what you want up front before you know you want it. Fingers crossed that there's no Runciter apps out there.

Also, I started off calling it The Hub but just couldn't face another Intranet related item called The Hub - there's enough already!
